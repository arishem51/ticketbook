# Requirement Clarification Rules

## Don't Make Assumptions

When answering, coding, or working on tasks, avoid making assumptions about unclear or ambiguous requirements.

## Ask for Clarification

When encountering:
- **Unclear requirements** - Requirements that are vague, ambiguous, or lack sufficient detail
- **Ridiculous requirements** - Requirements that seem unreasonable, contradictory, or potentially problematic

**Always ask the user to clarify** the requirement to ensure we understand exactly what needs to be done before proceeding.

This ensures accuracy, prevents misunderstandings, and saves time by avoiding unnecessary rework.
